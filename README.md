# workout-tracker-mapty

Hey, so this is my biggest portfolio project using vanilla JS. It is an app that basically works like a note taking app but over a leaflet map, with individual location pin-points representing each workouts tracked that could either be a cycling or running session.

For pulling off this project with vanilla JS, I had to dive into using geolocation browser API to fetch user's location to initiate the map, integrated leaflet library, positioning map marker over that map using leaflet docs, manage workout states using class based data structure and reflected each modifications over a localstorage object to retain workouts over page refreshes, and much more.

TLDR, have a look - https://rahulsomaliya.github.io/workout-tracker-mapty
